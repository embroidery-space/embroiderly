## How to Contribute

There are several areas of contribution:

- **Application.**
  We are happy to receive pull requests regarding the core code base of Embroiderly.
  Before starting to develop new features, please check out our [development guide](./DEVELOPMENT.md).

- **Documentation.**
  You can always edit the [documentation](https://github.com/embroidery-space/documentation).

  - **Specifications.**
    We are working on specifying the [cross-stitch pattern file format](https://github.com/embroidery-space/xsp-specs) supported by Embroiderly, making it much easier to understand its internal structure and then develop parsers.
    You are welcome to do so if you know how to improve them!

  - **Parsers.**
    Along with the development of cross-stitch pattern format specifications, we also develop the corresponding [parsers](https://github.com/embroidery-space/xsp-parsers).
