# Embroidery Studio üßµ

Embroidery Studio is a free and open source software for all cross stitchers.

## Backstory

[Pattern Maker for Cross Stitch] dominated the embroidery software industry for about 30 years.
It was a great software that provided users with many features to create embroidery patterns. üòç

Over the past decade, this product hasn't developed much, moving more to the maintenance stage.
And then on 31 December 2019, the company closed down, finally [ending support for][End of HobbyWare] and further development of PM, and completely disappeared from the horizon, there is no longer any contact with them.

At the moment, the only existing edition (at least the only one known to the author) is the russian ü§Æ cracked and patched version.
We strongly recommend that you don't even try to find this version, let alone download and install it, if you care about your information security.

It's worth noting that there are quite a few applications (both desktop and mobile) from other developers on the market.
However, most of them haven't moved far from the level of PM usability (and sometimes even took a step back).
They're very limited in terms of functionality: in general, they are just for viewing existing pattern, without the ability to edit and create new ones.

## Vision

Taking into account these circumstances and the author's love for the art of embroidery, it was decided to found and develop a fundamentally new application --- Embroidery Studio.
We plan to improve the already established basic functionality of this kind of software and implement an ideologically new one.
