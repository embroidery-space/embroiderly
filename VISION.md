## Plan

First, basic features must be implemented to make the application useful as soon as possible and start growing the user community.
Then, we will have to stabilize the API and release it stably.
After that, we can continue implementing all other fantastic ideas.

It will take a long time for us to release a stable version.
But we are not afraid of that; we are encouraged by it.

We want to engage more and more people in developing so it can ship updates quickly.
