# Embroiderly Parsers

This crate contains all parsers of patterns supported by Embroiderly:

- `embproj` - Our custom pattern format.
  In fact, this is just a zip archive that contains the pattern file in the OXS format near to XML files which contain the configuration of the project.

- `oxs` - Open cross-stitch pattern format that was created by [UrsaSoftware](https://ursasoftware.com).

- `xsd` (read-only) - A proprietary binary pattern format from [Pattern Maker for Cross Stitch](https://web.archive.org/web/20191127080612/http://hobbyware.com).
